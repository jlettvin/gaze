# Model for gaze reflex

Visit http://rawgit.com/jlettvin/gaze/master/gaze.html to run model.

Status:

* Airy.js unused but will generate better data for modeling diffraction patterns.
* bessel.js unused except by Airy.js
* gaze.css styling for gaze.html
* gaze.html the model
* gaze.js support code implementing the model

TODO:

* Replace completely fake diffraction with mathematically correct diffraction.
* Generate different pulse intervals for driving muscles.
* Cause pulses to drive muscle contraction.
* Cause muscle contraction to drive eyeball rotation.
* Fix crossover to generate data to change pulse intervals.
